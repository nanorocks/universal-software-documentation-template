# Event Storming Plan for Universal

This document outlines the complete event storming approach for modeling the Universal application domains. Event storming is a collaborative discovery process that helps identify domain events, commands, actors, policies, and read models through a series of structured workshops.

## Setup and Preparation

### Materials and Environment

- **Digital Board Setup**: Miro/Mural with color-coded sticky notes:
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Domain Events (past tense verbs, "what happened")
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Commands (imperative verbs, "do something")
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Actors/Users (who issues commands)
  - ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Aggregates (consistency boundaries)
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Policies/Reactions (when X happens, do Y)
  - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Hotspots/Questions (issues, unknowns)
  - ðŸŸ¤ **Brown**: External Systems
  - ðŸ’— **Pink**: Read Models (views/projections)

- **Board Layout**:
  - Timeline layout with swim lanes for each bounded context
  - Space for glossary and key decisions
  - Parking lot for future considerations

### Participants

- **Core Developer(s)**: Technical implementation perspective
- **Domain Expert(s)**: Personal finance knowledge

   - Understand investment tracking requirements
   - Define scope boundaries

2. **Participant Preparation**:
