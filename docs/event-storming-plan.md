# Event Storming Plan for Universal

This document outlines the complete event storming approach for modeling the Universal application domains. Event storming is a collaborative discovery process that helps identify domain events, commands, actors, policies, and read models through a series of structured workshops.

## Setup and Preparation

### Materials and Environment

- **Digital Board Setup**: Miro/Mural with color-coded sticky notes:
  - 🟠 **Orange**: Domain Events (past tense verbs, "what happened")
  - 🔵 **Blue**: Commands (imperative verbs, "do something")
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Actors/Users (who issues commands)
  - 🟣 **Purple**: Aggregates (consistency boundaries)
  - 🟢 **Green**: Policies/Reactions (when X happens, do Y)
  - 🔴 **Red**: Hotspots/Questions (issues, unknowns)
  - 🟤 **Brown**: External Systems
  - 💗 **Pink**: Read Models (views/projections)

- **Board Layout**:
  - Timeline layout with swim lanes for each bounded context
  - Space for glossary and key decisions
  - Parking lot for future considerations

### Participants

- **Core Developer(s)**: Technical implementation perspective
- **Domain Expert(s)**: Personal finance knowledge
- **Facilitator**: Guide discussion and keep focus
- **Observer/Note-taker**: Document key decisions and questions

### Pre-Workshop Activities

1. **Domain Research**:
   - Research existing personal finance tools
   - Collect sample subscription and bill records
   - Understand investment tracking requirements
   - Define scope boundaries

2. **Participant Preparation**:
